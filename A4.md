**4.1.31 Graph enumeration. How many different undirected graphs are there with V vertices and E edges (and no parallel edges)?**

$ V \choose 2​$ represents the number of ways to choose a pair of two vertices an undirected graph. Without self-loops there are $E​$ ways to choose the vertices to connect yielding $\binom{\binom{V}{2}}{E}​$ different undirected graphs with $V​$ and $E​$ edges (with no parallel edges and no self-loops). $2^V​$ represents the number of different self-looping permutations there are for an undirected graph. Therefore, ${{V}\choose{2}} \cdot 2^V​$ represents all the possible ways to choose a pair of vertices in which vertices may or may not have self-loops. From this set there are $E​$ ways to choose the vertices to connect yielding the equation (1).
$$
\binom{\binom{V}{2}\cdot 2^V}{E} = \frac{(\frac{V!}{2!(V-2)!} \cdot 2^V)!}{E! \cdot (\frac{V!}{2!(V-2)!} \cdot 2^V - E)!}
$$

**4.1.32 Parallel edge detection. Devise a linear-time algorithm to count the parallel edges in a graph.**

```java
int countParallelEdges(Graph G) {
    countParallel = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < G.V(); i++) {
        checkAdj = new boolean[G.V()];
        Arrays.fill(checkAdj, false);
        for (j : G.adj(i)) {
            if (!checkAdj[j]) 	{checkAdj[j] = true;}
            else 				{countParallel++;}
        }  
    return countParallel / 2; 
    }
}
```

This algorithm counts the parallel edges in a graph in linear-time. The algorithm implements the undirected graph API. It iterates through each of the vertices of the graph G once. For each iteration it initializes a list of Booleans ``checkAdj`` with false values (with size = to number of vertices). The second for loop iterates through the adjacency list of vertex "``i``"  and if it is the first time encountering a vertex, it changes the corresponding index in ``checkAdj`` from false to true. If it encounters a vertex in the adjacency list a second time, this indicates a parallel edge and therefore increments the ``countParallel`` value. We return ``countParallel/2`` because this value will be incremented twice for the same parallel edge (as it loops through both vertices). The algorithm is linear-time as it only loops through each vertex once and explore all edges of the graph twice $O(V + E)​$.



**4.2.31 Strong component. Describe a linear-time algorithm for computing the strong component containing a given vertex v. On the basis of that algorithm, describe a simple quadratic-time algorithm for computing the strong components of a digraph.**

To find the strong component containing a given vertex $v$ in linear-time we can use Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm to compute the strong components of the digraph in time proportional to $O(E+V)$. We can then iterate through each of the vertices in the digraph to find all the vertices with the same component ID as vertex $v$. This can be done in time proportional to $O(V)$, therefore, the total runtime of the algorithm is linear.

To find all the strong components of a digraph in quadratic-time we can run a DFS from any given source vertex. Then we need to run a DFS on every other vertex in the graph and store the vertices that can reach the source vertex. Next, we take the intersection of the two sets (vertices reachable from the source, and vertices that can reach the source), and return the strong component (marking all of these vertices with a component ID). We repeat this process for all other vertices not contained within a strong component, and continue this until all vertices are marked with a strongly connected component ID.



**4.2.41 Odd-length directed cycle. Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a digraph has an odd-length directed cycle.**

```java
boolean oddLengthDirectedCycle(Digraph diG) {
    kosarajuSharirSCC = new KosarajuSharirSCC(diG);
    strongCC = new HashSet[kosarajuSharirSCC.count()];
    
    for (v = 0; v < diG.V(); v++) {
        strongCC[ kosarajuSharirSCC.id(v) ].add(v)
    }
    
    for (i = 0; i < strongCC.length; i++) {
        undirGraph = new Graph(diG.V());
        for (v : strongCC[i]) {
            for (adjVertex : diG.adjacent(v)){
                if ( strongCC[i].contains(adjVertex) )
                    undirGraph.addEdge(vertex,neighbor);
            }
        }
        
        twoColor = new TwoColor(undirGraph);
        if (!twoColor.isBipartite()) {return true;}
    }
    
    return false;
}
```



We must first use Kosaraju-Sharir's algorithm to compute all the strongly connected components of the digraph in linear-time. We then store all of the vertices part of a strongly connected component ID in an array of hashsets. For each strongly connected component we create an undirected subgraph made up of only the vertices and edges within the strongly connected component. Using the twoColor API we can determine if this undirected cycle graph is bipartite. An undirected graph is bipartite iff it has no odd-length cycles. Therefore, if ``twoColor.isBipartite()`` returns false, then the strong connected component is an odd-length directed cycle. The algorithm is linear-time as it uses Kosaraju-Sharir's algorithm (linear-time) to find the strong components, creates undirected graphs for each strong component in linear-time, and uses the TwoColor alogorithm to determine the bipartiteness of the undirected subgraphs (from the strong components) in linear-time.



**4.2.43 Reachable vertex in a digraph. Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether a digraph has a vertex that is reachable from every other vertex.**

```java
boolean reachableVertex(Digraph diG) {
    kosarajuSharirSCC = new KosarajuSharirSCC(diG);
    strongCC = new ArrayList[kosarajuSharirSCC.count()];
    
    for (v = 0; v < diG.V(); v++) {
        strongCC[ kosarajuSharirSCC.id(v) ].add(v)
    }
    
    vertexLast = strongCC[0].get(0);
    reverseDiG = diG.reverse();
    marked = new boolean[diG.V()];
    
    DFS(reverseDiG, vertexLast, marked);
    
    for (v = 0; v < diG.V(); v++) {
        if (!marked[v]) {
            return false
        }
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

To determine is a vertex is reachable from every other vertex in a digraph, if we reversed all the edges of the digraph, it should be able to reach every other vertex with a DFS. So first we compute all the strong components using Kosaraju-Sharir's algorithm (linear-time). Kosaraju-Sharir's algorithm outputs the strong components in reverse topological order, therefore the vertex that could potentially be reached by every other vertex is stored at ``strongCC[0].get(0)``. We then use the digraph API to compute the reverse digraph, and run a DFS on this `reverseDiG`. If every vertex has been marked, we can conclude that this vertex is reachable from every other vertex in the original digraph. The algorithm is linear-time as it uses Kosaraju-Sharir's algorithm (linear-time) to find the strong components, a single DFS to mark each component (linear-time), and for-loops that cycle through each vertex of the graph only once.



**4.3.20 True or false: At any point during the execution of Kruskal’s algorithm, each vertex is closer to some vertex in its subtree than to any vertex not in its subtree. Prove your answer.**

True. Kruskal's algorithm considers edges in increasing order of weight. Therefore, every edge connected between vertices is of minimal weight and all subtrees are made up of minimal weight edges. For example we can analyze how Kruskal's algorithm would process edge $e  = v-u$ of length 1 and edge $f = v-q$ of length 2:

1. Edge $e$ is chosen before edge $f$. Vertex $v$ is closer to vertex $u$ in its subtree than vertex $q$ which is not in its subtree.
2. Edge edge $e​$ is skipped an edge $f​$ is chosen instead. This can only occur if edge edge $e​$ creates a cycle. The only way this can happen is if there is another vertex connecting $v​$ and $u​$. This means that the edge between this arbitrary vertex $a​$  and vertex $v​$ is less then the length of $e​$. And so the property still holds as vertex $v​$ is closer to a vertex in its subtree than to a vertex not in its subtree.



**4.3.32 Specified set. Given a connected edge-weighted graph G and a specified set of edges S (having no cycles), describe a way to find a minimum-weight spanning tree of G among those spanning trees that contain all the edges in S.**

1. Sort all the edges of $G$ by weight. 
2. Iterate through the sorted edges in increasing order (by weight), For each edge:
   1. Only if it is contained in $S$, and does not generate a cycle, add it to the current MST. If the any of the two conditions are violated (not in $S$, or generates a cycle) do nothing and continue.
3. Finish once all edges have been processed or the MST has $V-1$ edges ($V$ = number of vertices in G).
4. Check if the result is an MST by running a DFS from the first vertex and checking if all vertices are visited. If this is violated the result is not an MST (minimum-spanning forest) and throw an exception.



**4.4.25 Shortest path between two subsets. Given a digraph with positive edge weights, and two distinguished subsets of vertices S and T, find a shortest path from any vertex in S to any vertex in T. Your algorithm should run in time proportional to E log V, in the worst case.**

```java
Iterable<DirectedEdge> ShortestPathBetweenTwoSubsets(EdgeWeightedDigraph G, HashSet<Integer> subset_S, HashSet<Integer> subset_T) {
    
    //Copy of the original graph with an addtional vertex v = G.V() + 1
    copy = new EdgeWeightedDigraph(G.V() + 1); 
    for (int v = 0; v < G.V(); v++) {
        for ( DirectedEdge e : G.adj(v) ) {
            copy.addEdge(e); 
        }
    }
    
    //New vertex v has length 0 to each vertex in subset_S
    for (int source : subset_S.key()) {
        copy.addEdge(new DirectedEdge(G.V() + 1, source, 0.0));
	}
    
    //Run Dijkstra's Algorithm once from vertex v - O(E Log V)
    dijkstraSP = new DijkstraSP(copy, G.V() + 1);
    
    //Check for shortest path to a vertex in subset_T
    minDist = MAX_INT_VALUE //Assume this is the largest integer value possible
    shortestPathVertex = 0;
    for (int finalV : subset_F.keys()) {
    	if (dijkstraSP.distTo(finalV) < minDist) {
			minDist = dijkstraSP.distTo(finalV);
            shortestPathVertex = finalV;
        }
    }
    //Return the path to the vertex determined to have the shortest distance from a vertex
    //in subset_T. Ignore the first vertex in this path and you have your SP for graph G.
    return dijkstraSP.pathTo(shortestPathVertex);
}
```



This can be solved calling Dijkstra's algorithm once resulting in time proportional to $O(E \log N)​$. We first need to modify the graph by adding a new vertex $v​$ that has edges of length 0 from $v​$ to each vertex in $S​$. Next, we run Dijkstra's algorithm starting from vertex $v​$. It will compute the distance from $v​$ to all the vertices in digraph, and the length of the shortest path from any vertex in $S​$ to vertex $v​$ will be the same. We can then compute the minimum path from $v​$ to some vertex in $T​$. Then, we can remove vertex $v​$ and we are left with the minimum path from some vertex in $S​$ to some vertex in $T​$. The resulting algorithm runs in time proportional to $O(E \log N)​$ as only one call to Dijkstra shortest path algorithm is made, and the rest of the operations are done in time less than $O(E \log N)​$.



**4.4.33 Shortest path in a grid. Given an N-by-N matrix of positive integers, find the shortest path from the (0, 0) entry to the (N-1, N-1) entry, where the length of the path is the sum of the integers in the path. Repeat the problem but assume you can only move right and down.**

For the first part of this problem we can convert the grid into a digraph. Each entry of the $N​$ by $N​$ matrix is a vertex with all edges directed towards the vertex from it's adjacent vertices (left/right, up/down), are the value of it's grid entry (see example picture below for part 1). We can then use Dijkstra's algorithm using the first entry at grid position $(0,0)​$ as our source vertex and determine the shortest path to the final entry $(N-1,N-1)​$.

For the second part of this problem we can similarly convert our grid into a digraph, this time each vertex should have at most 2 edges directed towards it (one from the left, one from above), each with the value of it's grid entry (see example picture below for part 2). We can then execute Dijkstra's algorithm using the first entry at grid position $(0,0)​$ as our source vertex and determine the shortest path to the final entry $(N-1,N-1)​$.

**4.4.47 Bellman-Ford negative cycle detection. Show that if any edge is relaxed during the Vth pass of the generic Bellman-Ford algorithm, then the edgeTo[] array has a directed cycle and any such cycle is a negative cycle.**

The highest possible number of edges in a shortest path is $V-1$ which is a path that passes through all vertices in the graph. If there are no negative cycles in the present, the shortest paths will be computed after the $V-1$ pass of the algorithm and no edges will be relaxed in any future passes including the Vth pass (Proposition X - pp.671). Therefore if any edge is relaxed in the Vth pass, it indicates that there is a new shortest path that uses V edges. This can only occur if there is a negative cycle. The edgeTo[] array stores the paths found and it will have a directed cycle and any such cycle is a negative cycle.
