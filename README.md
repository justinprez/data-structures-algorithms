# Data Structures & Algorithms

The project here consists of my coursework projects for the [Udacity Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256).
This repository contains 4 projects which I completed to get my Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree from Udacity.

### Project 1- Unscramble Computer Science Problems
This project was under the course section of the Introduction.

### Project 2- Show Me the Data Structures
This project was under the course section of Data Structures which included topics like Arrays, Linked Lists, Queues, Recursion, Trees, Maps, and Hashing.

### Project 3- Problems vs. Algorithms
This project was under the course section of Basic Algorithms which included topics like Binary Search, Heaps, Tries, Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Merge, Quick, and Heap sort), and Divide and Conquer Algorithms.

### Project 4- Route Planner
This project was under the final course section of Advanced Algorithms and included topics like Greedy Algorithms, Graph Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, and A* Search with Heuristic Functions.
