# Analysis


## Problem 1
collections.OrderedDict() is used as the main data structure for the cache. This data structure was chosen because it keeps the order of insertion, which is crucial for the LRU policy. Elements can be efficiently added or removed from both ends. When an item is accessed (using the get method) or added/updated (using the set method), it is moved to the end of the OrderedDict. This way, the least recently used items are always at the beginning.
### Time Complexity
The get method has a time complexity of O(1) for both the key not in self.cache check and the move_to_end operation.
The set method has a time complexity of O(1) for setting a value, moving it to the end of the ordered dictionary, and popping the first item.
### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(capacity) because the cache will store at most capacity number of key-value pairs.


## Problem 2
The function employs a recursive algorithm, which is a natural choice for problems that involve a tree or graph-like structure, such as a file system.
The algorithm uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach, diving deep into each directory before backtracking.
### Time Complexity
The function find_files traverses every directory and file under the given path. Therefore, in the worst case, it has to visit each file and subdirectory once. If there are n files/subdirectories in total, the time complexity is O(n).
The endswith operation checks the suffix of each file, which is O(1) as string length for filenames will generally be small and constant.
The os.listdir operation is linear in the number of entries in the directory.
### Space Complexity
The list_of_paths list will at most contain all the files that match the given suffix. Therefore, in the worst case, its size will be n, giving a space complexity of O(n).
There is also a recursive call for subdirectories, and in the worst case, if all directories are nested one inside the other, the recursive call stack will grow to the depth of these directories. However, the stack space is typically limited, and the overall space complexity remains O(n).


## Problem 3
A Min Heap (implemented using Python's heapq) is used to ensure the two nodes with the smallest frequencies are combined first, which is essential for Huffman coding.
The choice to use a Counter object to determine character frequencies in the data is apt, as it offers a concise and efficient way to achieve this.
A separate Node class is defined to facilitate the creation and manipulation of the Huffman tree. Its __lt__ method ensures nodes are compared based on frequency in the heap.
The decision to handle the edge case of a single character input separately was done by pushing an additional node with a frequency of 0.
### Time complexity
Building the frequency count with Counter(data) is O(n), where n is the length of the input data.
Constructing the Huffman tree with the heap operations: In the worst-case scenario, it involves n heappush and n/2 heappop operations, giving it an O(n log n) complexity.
Constructing the encoding table by traversing the Huffman tree is O(n).
The encoding and decoding processes both involve traversing the input data once, giving them a time complexity of O(n).
The overall time complexity is O(n log n).
### Space Complexity
The frequency count dictionary, the heap with nodes, and the code table all occupy space. The overall space complexity is O(n).


## Problem 4
The algorithm checks for a user's membership in a group recursively. It first checks the immediate group. If the user isn't found, the function recursively checks all subgroups. The recursion allows for an elegant solution that can handle multiple levels of nested groups.
### Time Complexity
The function first checks if the user is present in the current group's users list. This check involves going through all the users in that group, leading to O(u) for u users. If the user is not found in the immediate group, the function recursively checks each subgroup. For every subgroup, the same process is repeated - checking all users and then all subgroups. This leads to a time complexity of O(g) for each group and its subgroups. Therefore, in the worst-case scenario where the function has to check all users in all groups and subgroups, the time complexity is O(u x g).
### Space Complexity
Space complexity is O(g), where the primary space overhead is from the recursive call stack, which grows with the depth of the nested groups, not with the number of users.


## Problem 5
The Block class represents individual blocks in the blockchain. Each block contains a timestamp, data, previous block's hash (which acts as a link to the previous block), and its own hash.
The BlockChain class acts as a singly linked list of blocks, where each block points to its predecessor via the previous_hash attribute.
The blockchain's append method ensures the chaining of blocks, where each block is linked to its predecessor.
The search method linearly traverses the blockchain from the tail (latest block) to the oldest block.
### Time Complexity
The complexity for each of the methods implemented are given:
-	init: O(1)
-	append: O(1)
-	search: O(n)
-	get_size: O(1)
### Space Complexity
The space used by the blockchain is linear, O(n), where n is the number of blocks. Each append operation increases the size of the blockchain by one block.


## Problem 6
The union and intersection functions convert the linked lists to sets for efficient set operations.
The results of these set operations are then converted back into linked lists.
This approach leverages the efficiency of set operations in Python but has the overhead of converting between linked lists and sets.
### Time Complexity
union: The method first converts both linked lists to sets with O(n) and O(m) time complexities respectively, where n and m are the sizes of the two linked lists. The union operation on sets is O(n+m). The loop that appends values from the unioned set to the linked list has a time complexity of O(n+m) due to the append operation. Overall, the time complexity is O(n+m).
intersection: This method follows the same logic as union, making its time complexity also O(n+m).
### Space Complexity
Both these methods create a new linked list for the result. In the worst case, for the union method, this linked list could be of size n+m. Thus, the space complexity is O(n+m).
